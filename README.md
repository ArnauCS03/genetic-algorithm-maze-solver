# Genetic Algorithm Maze Solver

This repository contains the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for solving a maze in Python. The soluction can be found in the file **Task3.py**.

<br>
Additionally, other tasks related to genetic algorithms and machine learning, such as:

- Plotting the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using GA
- Implementing the Fitness function for an optimization problem using GA
- Performing Regression on Data using multiple methods

These tasks are implemented separately, and their problem statements can be found in the file `Assignment_course` .

## Explanation of the GA for solving the maze

The objective of this task is to find an optimal path through a maze, guiding a virtual mouse to reach the destination (food) using the shortest and most efficient route. The GA optimizes the path automatically using evolutionary principles.

The maze is represented as a 2D matrix, where: 1 indicates a valid path and 100 represents an obstacle.
